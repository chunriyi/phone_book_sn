# phone_book_sn

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
--------------------
The Phone Book Management System is used to store customers' information. The system manager can add, edit, delete, and save customers' info, or revert the previous actions. 
The system manager can search customers' information by entering the 1st letter of the customers' last name in 'Seach by Customer Last Name'. The system manager can also search customers' information by entering the customers' date of birth in 'Search by Date of Birth.'

INSTALLATION
--------------------
I developed the project using Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server 2014 Management Studio. The folder 'Phone_Book' and the file Phone_Book_sn.sln is the C# coding part of the project, and the file 'phone_book.mdf' is the SQL database file. I attached the Phone Book database in SQL Server 2014 Management Studio.

NOTIFICATION
--------------------
The customer's ID is unique and cannot be empty, so it is the primary key in the Phone Book database. 
When you use Visual Studio 2019 to run the program, please remember to create a connection to the Phone Book database in SQL Server 2014 Management Studio.
